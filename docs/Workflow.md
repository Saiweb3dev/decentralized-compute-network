### ‚úÖ **Workflow:**
1. **Client Sends Task:**  
   - The client (user) submits a computational task via a **REST API** to the **Task Manager (Node.js backend)**.  
   - The request includes **task type**, **input data**, and **user metadata** (e.g., wallet address for rewards tracking).  

2. **Task Manager Handles Task:**  
   - Saves the request in **MongoDB** with a **pending** status.  
   - Checks for **available worker nodes** from the **worker pool** (stored in DB or tracked in-memory).  
   - Assigns the task **randomly** or based on a load-balancing algorithm.  

3. **Worker Node Processes Task:**  
   - The Task Manager sends the task to a **Worker Node (Go gRPC service)** via **gRPC**.  
   - The Worker Node executes the requested computation (e.g., hashing, encryption, modular exponentiation).  

4. **Worker Node Returns Computation Result:**  
   - The Worker Node sends the computed result **back to the Task Manager** via **gRPC response**.  
   - The Task Manager **verifies** the result (if applicable).  

5. **Task Completion & Logging:**  
   - The Task Manager updates the **MongoDB task status** to **completed**.  
   - Logs worker **performance points** based on the task difficulty & execution time.  
   - Returns the **computed result** to the **client** via REST API response.  

6. **Reward Distribution:**  
   - At scheduled intervals, the Task Manager **calls the smart contract** (Ethereum) to update rewards.  
   - Rewards are **distributed based on accumulated worker points**.  
   - Workers can **claim** their rewards (e.g., ERC-20 tokens) from the contract.

### üîç **Key Refinements:**
- **Worker Assignment:** Instead of sending tasks randomly, you may want to use a **fair scheduling** or **priority-based** load-balancing mechanism.
- **Result Verification:** If the task type allows, you may implement **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** or **redundant computation** to verify correctness.
- **Reward Calculation:** Ensure that **task complexity, response time, and reliability** are factored into worker points.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Use an **off-chain batch update** to avoid frequent gas fees when updating rewards.
