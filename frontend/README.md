Since your project **Decentralized Distributed Compute Network (DDCN)** involves users submitting compute tasks, worker nodes processing them, and a blockchain-based reward system, the frontend should be intuitive and informative. Here's a well-structured breakdown of the required pages and features.

## **🚀 Frontend Structure for DDCN**
### **📌 Pages & Features**
| **Page**             | **Route** | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Landing Page**     | `/`       | Introduction, Features, Call-to-Action (CTA) |
| **Dashboard**        | `/dashboard` | View submitted jobs, status, and results |
| **Submit Task**      | `/submit-task` | Form to submit a computation job |
| **Task Details**     | `/task/:id` | View task progress, result, and verification details |
| **Node Status**      | `/nodes` | View active worker nodes and performance |
| **Earnings (For Nodes)** | `/earnings` | View earned rewards for completing tasks |
| **Profile & Settings** | `/profile` | User account, wallet connection, and settings |
| **Login/Register**   | `/auth` | Authentication via wallet or email/password |

- 📝 Add description
- 💵 Set max gas/fee (for task execution)
- 🔄 Submit to smart contract

---

### **4️⃣ Task Details (`/task/:id`)**
- ✅ Task ID, status, and assigned worker node
- 🏗 Worker progress updates (via WebSockets or polling)
- 📂 Link to **IPFS-stored result**
- 🔗 Smart contract verification proof

---

### **5️⃣ Node Status (`/nodes`)**
- 🖥 Active worker nodes

- 💰 Earned rewards per node

---

### **6️⃣ Earnings (`/earnings`)**
- 💰 Total earnings from task execution
- 🔗 Withdraw earnings (wallet integration)
- 📜 Smart contract transactions

---

### **7️⃣ Profile & Settings (`/profile`)**
- 🔗 Connect Wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- 📜 View transaction history
- 🛠 Node Operator Settings

---

### **8️⃣ Login / Register (`/auth`)**
- 🔑 Wallet-based authentication
- 📧 Email/password (if using Firebase/Auth0)

---

## **🌟 UI Components & Tech**
- ✅ **ShadCN/UI** (Buttons, Modals, Tables)
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** (Styling)
- 🎭 **Framer Motion** (Smooth UI Animations)
- 🔥 **Web3 Modal** (For wallet connection)
- 🔄 **React Query or SWR** (Fetch real-time data)
- 📡 **WebSockets** (Live task status updates)

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
1️⃣ Set up **Next.js with routing** (`pages` or `app` directory).  
2️⃣ Implement **ShadCN UI components** for forms, tables, and modals.  
3️⃣ Build **state management** (React Context/Zustand or Redux if needed).  
4️⃣ Integrate **Web3 wallet authentication** (ethers.js + wagmi).  
5️⃣ Connect **Backend API** (`/api` for fetching tasks, submitting jobs).  
6️⃣ Optimize **real-time updates** (WebSockets for task execution tracking).
